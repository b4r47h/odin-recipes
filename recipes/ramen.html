    <h3>Arigato Ithikamas</h3>
    <p>Ramen Ichiraku is Naruto Uzumaki's favourite dining establishment. He eats there regularly – usually stopping by between missions – and he is often joined by Iruka Umino, another frequent customer. Because Naruto has been a loyal customer for most of his life, Teuchi and his daughter, Ayame, were among the few people in Konoha not to treat Naruto with animosity during his youth.[2] Naruto takes Hinata Hyūga to Ramen Ichiraku for their first date</p>
